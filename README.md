Team coding tips:
-Use self-explanatory variable and function names.
-For each function, give a short comment of what it does.
-If one team member would like to make a change to a code written by someone else, they can notify that person about the change and it will be up to them if they want to change it or not.
-Make one css file for each UI screen.
