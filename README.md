# Team coding tips:
* Use self-explanatory variable and function names.
* Use constants instead of numbers. For example, const MAX_USERS = 100;
* For each function, give a short comment of what it does.
* If a function has more than 10 lines of code, it is suggested to split it among multiple functions
* If one team member would like to make a change to a code written by someone else, they can notify that person about the change and it will be up to them if they want to change it or not.
* Make one css file for each UI screen.
